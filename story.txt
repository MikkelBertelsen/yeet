Every day John was waking up at 8. AM, taking shower, having a breakfast and going to work.
But today strange thing happened. John woke up and went to bathroom, where he saw a fat chicken in his bathtop!
It was so chunky that fat was spilling out of the top. John looked at the chicken and quickly closed the door.
John ran out into his garden and looked up at the bathroom window. He could see that the chicken was growing in size.
Soon after the chicken filled the entire house and the house exploded in a supernova!
