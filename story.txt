Every day John was waking up at 8. AM, taking shower, having a breakfast and going to work.
But today strange thing happened. John woke up and went to bathroom, where he saw a giant poop.
John did not like it, so he left the bathroom and he saw a bird out of the window.
The bird was chirping and singing in a way that John liked.
John looked at the bird and the bird looked at John.
Then the bird flew over to John and sat on his hand looking up at him.
It was a chicken, he saw a fat chicken in his bathtub!
It was so chunky that fat was spilling out of the tub. John looked at the chicken and quickly closed the door.
John ran out into his garden and looked up at the bathroom window. He could see that the chicken was growing in size.
Soon after the chicken filled the entire house and the house exploded in a supernova!
