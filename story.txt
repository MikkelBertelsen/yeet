Every day John was waking up at 8. AM, taking shower, having a breakfast and going to work.
But today strange thing happened. John woke up and went to bathroom, where he saw a bird out of the window.
The bird was chirping and singing in a way that John liked.
John looked at the bird and the bird looked at John.
Then the bird flew over to John and sat on his hand looking up at him.
